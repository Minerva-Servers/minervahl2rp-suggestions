This is the place where you would suggest features, removals or changes towards the Half-Life 2 Roleplay Server.

## Suggestion Tutorial
If you want to create a new suggestion please click the Issues tab on the top left if you are on computer, and press the green button "New issue". If you are ready then submit the issue. If you have any further questions feel free to ask us in the discord!

## Suggestion Rules
### 1. Keep it on-topic
Ideas should be related to the Half-Life 2 Universe, and not stray too far from the server's purpose.

### 2. Be respectful
Ideas should not be rude or offensive to other members of the community. This includes avoiding hate speech, personal attacks, or any other form of harassment.

### 3. Avoid duplicates
Before submitting an idea, make sure to check if it has already been suggested. Duplicates will be removed to avoid clutter.

### 4. Provide details
Make sure to provide enough information about your idea so that others can understand it. This includes any benefits or drawbacks of the idea.

### 5. No spamming
Do not submit multiple ideas at once, and do not repeatedly post the same idea. This can be seen as spamming and may result in a warning or ban.

### 6. Follow server rules
Make sure to follow all the rules and guidelines of the Discord server when submitting ideas. Failure to do so may result in consequences.

### 7. Be open to feedback
Suggestions may be discussed and debated by other members of the community. Be open to feedback and constructive criticism.
